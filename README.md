# Pose-Estimation-using-YOLOv7
Previously, I worked on several computer vision and YOLOv3 projects like the automatic out-of-stock inventory management system. But, since YOLOv7 is considered as one of the best object detection algorithms, I gave it a try! Created in the year 2015, by Joseph Redmon (who also proposed YOLOv2 & YOLOv3). Since then, the open soure contributors have collaborated together to create more versions in the YOLO family like:

YOLOv4, YOLOv5, PP-YOLO, Scaled YOLOv4, PP-YOLOv2, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7 (built on top of YOLOR - You Only Learn One Representation). YOLOv7 is more than just an object detection architecture. It provides a new model head that emits keypoints (skeleton) and can perform instance segmentation with just bounding box regression.

Why did I use a YOLO model?

Enables me to process video feeds at a high frames-per-second rate. My computer uses intel integrated graphics, which poses various processing limitations.

Continuing R&D from the open-source community. YOLOv7 being the latest addition.

No shortage of information or bug removals while implementing a model.
